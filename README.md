# knightsTour
 Recursively tries to solve the Knight's Tour problem on a board of N length. Currently, a value of 5 works fine but any increase in N increases time complexity exponentially. 
 
 I'm looking at optimising the algorithm so I may solve the tour on an 8*8 grid but for now this is a simple yet inefficient implementation.
